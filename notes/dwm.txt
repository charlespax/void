patch: attachbottom
file: dwm-attachbottom-6.3.diff
url: http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/attachbelow/
description: New windows are spawned at the bottom of the stack. Thus, the
window at the top of the stack will remain at the top of the stack.

Suggested Packages
-----------------------------
Alpha - for the pretty

alwayscenter - floating window is always centered.
    I wonder if this would put dmenu in the center.

Attach side - open stack next to master

autostart - start applications
    Instead of putting things in xinitrc, we can use autostart.

Combo - lets you join 2 tags; functionality I miss most on other WMs

Flextile deluxe - better layouts

movestack - move windows through the stack with key commands

pertag - each tag tracks is own layout.

scratchpad - open a terminal or app in a floating window?

Stacker - makes working with stack easy

Systray - nice to have a systray

Swallow - for when I start program somewhere besides dmenu

vanity gaps - for the pretty

Zoomswap - swapping master/stack sides
